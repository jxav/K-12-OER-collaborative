# K-12 OER Collaborative
The K–12 OER Collaborative is an initiative led by a group of 12 states and multiple NGOs (including Creative Commons) with the goal of creating comprehensive, high-quality, open educational resources (OER) supporting K–12 mathematics and English language arts that are aligned with state learning standards. All materials created by the project are licensed CC BY 4.0. This project supports local control by empowering states to adapt these materials to meet their particular needs using their own channels of review. http://k12oercollaborative.org
